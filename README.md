# Hello there! <img src = "https://media.tenor.com/images/aadee35242e901eb394dcf5680ba5acb/tenor.gif" width = "25px">

I'm Jacopo Braccio, a computer science and automation engineer.<br> I'm currently enrolled in the master degree course ["ICT for Smart Societies"](https://didattica.polito.it/laurea_magistrale/ict_for_smart_societies/en/home) at [Politecnico di Torino](https://www.polito.it/index.php?lang=en), discovering how the new ICT technologies may be applied in different application domains (such as health, transport, building, energy...) in order to improve life quality.
